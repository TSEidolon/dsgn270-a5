Prototype video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps6p9e6QmgY" target="_blank"> Prototyping animations with Figma by Kevin Powell </a>

 - Pages kept switching to other pages during prototyping.
    - Realized the interactions were set to `“on hover”` so when the mouse is hovered on the page links it instantly switches to the linked page.
    - Fixed when interactions were changed to `“on-clink”`.

Design concepts:
- Accidentally made a Butterfly SVG logo when I was experimenting on how to create SVGs.
    - Ended up making a retailer website for reptiles, insects, fishes, etc.
- Because the retailer specializes in reptiles, the colour palette I chose revolved around the colour green, black and white.

Prototype animations used:
 - “Flow” and “Hover” animations used in this prototype.
